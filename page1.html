            <p id="tribute-ingo">It’s actually a Guy Fawkes mask. Guy Fawkes was a British Catholic who attempted to blow up the houses of Parliament with Gunpowder in what is commonly known as “The Gunpowder Plot”. He and his conspirators were caught, tried and were sentenced to be hanged, but Guy fell off the scaffold and broke his neck before he could be hanged. To celebrate the failure of the plot (also mean to bring down the king and his heir), on November 5th, England Celebrates “Guy Fawkes Day”, with bonfires and fireworks as well as the burning of an effigy known as a “guy”, which has become slang for any male person, such as “you guys”.
                The mask is a stylized depiction of Guy Fawkes himself. Since he was viewed as a protestor against the government, it was used as V’s mask in V for Vendetta, both the comic and, later, the movie. <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-Anonymous-mask-or-Vendetta-mask-symbolize" target="_blank" id="tribute_link">Read more</a></p>
